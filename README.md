The code above shows how to create and read files based on user input.
The implementation of this method is for account feature.

Other from account feature, this basic method is usable for saving player stats for game.
Ex: Player 1 and player 2 with different progresses.

How the program works ?
1. The program will input username and password, then write it on the same file.
2. Users are asked to input the username and password that have been entered before
3. Users input the content of the file.
4. Then, the program saved the content with file format : "user_input.txt"
5. The program also could read the file content based on users username and password.
